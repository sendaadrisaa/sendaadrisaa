# Hello, Middle-earth! 👋

## About Me
I'm a woman programmer who is passionate about writing code and solving problems. I have a strong interest in web development and data science. But when I'm not coding, you can find me immersed in the world of Middle-earth. I'm a huge fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" series. 🧙‍♂️🧝‍♀️🌋

## My Projects
Here are some of my projects related to "The Lord of the Rings":

1. **Middle-earth Map**: An interactive map of Middle-earth built with JavaScript and Leaflet.js.
2. **Elvish Translator**: A fun translator app that converts English to Elvish.
3. **LOTR API**: A RESTful API that provides information about the characters, places, and events in "The Lord of the Rings".

## Connect with Me
Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://github.com/tchapi/markdown-cheatsheet/blob/master/README.md) or send me an email at `example@email.com`. If you're a fellow LOTR fan, let's chat about our favorite characters and theories!

## Fun Fact
My favorite character in "The Lord of the Rings" is Samwise Gamgee. His loyalty and courage remind me that even the smallest person can change the course of the future. 💪
